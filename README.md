Violence can do great harm to people's physical and psychological health. Monitoring large amounts of video footage requires manual inspection for long periods which can easily lead to distraction and fatigue due to the limited capabilities of video processing systems. We want to find out if we can develop an effective violence detection system that utilizes multimodal data (such as audio and visual) from surveillance footage and social media videos to automatically detect and classify violent events in real-time.

### Agenda

1.	Creating a safer environment
2.	Preventing domestic violence
3.	Enhancing law enforcement
4.	Raising awareness
5.	Reducing trauma

What we want to achieve is automation in surviellance systems to detect any sort of violence.
